# Tic Tac Toe
Tic tac toe I game created using html, css, and vanilla üç¶ javascript. 
This project was originally for a take-home assessment for a job interview, and turned out "pretty ok". 
I focused on doing the basics with functional programming, invocations, declarations, callbacks and binding elements to the dom. 

## The UI
I wanted the ui to feel pretty minimal, but friendly and fun. So it could easily be played by kids. The colors are reminiscent of something like mint chocolate chip which was one of my favorite ice
creams growing up. 

### The future 
Eventually I'd like to port this over to [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) and componentize it, improve it, and make it more scalable. Perhaps with `n` squares instead of the traditional 3x3 grid.
